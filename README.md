## How Analytics Work

- Each task stores:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Completion timestamp
- Analytics are computed entirely in the browser:
  - Daily and weekly completions
  - Rolling averages
  - Completion streaks
  - Time-to-complete calculations
- Heatmap visualizes productivity density over time

No data ever leaves the browser.
